      <PolicySection id="section-3" title="3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?">
        <p>
          <strong>In Short:</strong> We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e. legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfil our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfil our legitimate business interests.
        </p>
        <p><strong>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</strong></p>
        <p>
          The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Consent.</strong> We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e. consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more about withdrawing your consent.</li>
          <li><strong>Performance of a Contract.</strong> We may process your personal information when we believe it is necessary to fulfil our contractual obligations to you, including providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with you.</li>
          <li><strong>Legal Obligations.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</li>
          <li><strong>Vital Interests.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In legal terms, we are generally the &apos;data controller&apos; under European data protection laws of the personal information described in this Privacy Notice, since we determine the means and/or purposes of the data processing we perform. This Privacy Notice does not apply to the personal information we process as a &apos;data processor&apos; on behalf of our customers. In those situations, the customer that we provide services to and with whom we have entered into a data processing agreement is the &apos;data controller&apos; responsible for your personal information, and we merely process your information on their behalf in accordance with your instructions. If you want to know more about our customers&apos; privacy practices, you should read their privacy policies and direct any questions you have to them.
        </p>
        <p><strong>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</strong></p>
        <p>
          We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e. express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e. implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time.
        </p>
        <p>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
          <li>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way</li>
          <li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>
          <li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>
          <li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim</li>
          <li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</li>
          <li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse</li>
          <li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</li>
          <li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records</li>
          <li>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced</li>
          <li>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</li>
          <li>If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We may disclose de-identified information for approved research or statistics projects, subject to ethics oversight and confidentiality commitments</p>
      </PolicySection>

      <PolicySection id="section-4" title="4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?">
        <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the following third parties.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Vendors, Consultants, and Other Third-Party Service Providers.</strong> We may share your data with third-party vendors, service providers, contractors, or agents (&apos;third parties&apos;) who perform services for us or on our behalf and require access to such information to do that work. We have contracts in place with our third parties, which are designed to help safeguard your personal information. This means that they cannot do anything with your personal information unless we have instructed them to do it. They will also not share your personal information with any organisation apart from us. They also commit to protect the data they hold on our behalf and to retain it for the period we instruct.
        </p>
        <p>The third parties we may share personal information with are as follows:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
          <li><strong>Communicate and Chat with Users:</strong> Calendly</li>
          <li><strong>Functionality and Infrastructure Optimisation:</strong> Formspree</li>
          <li><strong>Website Hosting:</strong> Vercel</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We also may need to share your personal information in the following situations:</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Business Transfers.</strong> We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.
        </p>
      </PolicySection>

      <PolicySection id="section-5" title="5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?">
        <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless otherwise required by law.</p>
        <p>
          We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than 2 years.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
        </p>
      </PolicySection>

      <PolicySection id="section-6" title="6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?">
        <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organisational and technical security measures.</p>
        <p>
          We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organisational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.
        </p>
      </PolicySection>

      <PolicySection id="section-7" title="7. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?">
        <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age or the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction.</p>
        <p>
          We do not knowingly collect, solicit data from, or market to children under 18 years of age or the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction, nor do we knowingly sell such personal information. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent&apos;s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age or the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18 or the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction, please contact us at <EmailLink />.

      </PolicySection>

      <PolicySection id="section-8" title="8. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?">
        <p><strong>In Short:</strong> Depending on your state of residence in the US or in some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, and Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your country, province, or state of residence.</p>
        <p>
          In some regions (like the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data portability; and (v) not to be subject to automated decision-making. If a decision that produces legal or similarly significant effects is made solely by automated means, we will inform you, explain the main factors, and offer a simple way to request human review. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section &apos;HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?&apos; below.
        </p>
        <p>We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
        <p>If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your Member State data protection authority or UK data protection authority.</p>
        <p>If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Withdrawing your consent:</strong> If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section &apos;HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?&apos; below.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Opting out of marketing and promotional communications:</strong> You can unsubscribe from our marketing and promotional communications at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send, or by contacting us using the details provided in the section &apos;HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?&apos; below. You will then be removed from the marketing lists. However, we may still communicate with you, for example, to send you service-related messages that are necessary for the administration and use of your account, to respond to service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes.

      <PolicySection id="section-9" title="9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES">
        <p>
          Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (&apos;DNT&apos;) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.
        </p>
        <p>
          California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognising or honouring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.
